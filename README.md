###Summary:

This objective of this project is to develop a personal weather predictor. This system is based on a science gateway architecture where most of its functions are developed as microservices in a distributed environment. Microservices are build using mainly two languages - Java and Python whereas API Gateway is developed on Node.js framework and UI in HTML/JavaScript.
